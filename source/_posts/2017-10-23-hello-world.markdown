All new programming tutorials start with Hello World! This is not actually a programming tutorial, but the hope is to share a piece of information which could be useful for someone. I wanted to start with Hello World anyway.

This is a project I delayed a very long time, and now it is time. I will try to cover a diverse set of topics including Programming Languages, Touch Typing, Editors, Note Taking and a lot more.

See you next time with my first blog on touch typing: Do programmers actually need touch typing?
